Welcome to the Apigee App Services template app for Android!

App Services is Apigee’s hosted version of the open-source technology “Usergrid” — you may find references to that name in a few places. 

You need to make a few edits for this template to work. Follow the instructions in src/com/apigee/appservices/android_template/MainActivity.java

If you followed the steps correctly, you should see a visual confirmation when you run the app.
